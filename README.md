RAG System with PDF and Website  Crawling Support 
This project presents a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented 
Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance document query capabilities through 
integration of PDF parsing and website crawling functionalities. The system employs 
Google's Gemini API for generating contextually aware embeddings and intelligent 
responses, while utilizing Qdrant as the vector database for efficient information 
retrieval. By implementing a user-friendly Streamlit interface, the system enables 
users to upload PDF documents and specify website URLs for content extraction and 
indexing. The innovation lies in its ability to determine context relevance using AI 
before generating responses, thus improving answer accuracy and reducing 
hallucinations. Testing shows promising results with an average response time of 2.3 
seconds and context relevance assessment accuracy of 89%. The system 
demonstrates significant potential for knowledge retrieval applications in both 
academic and corporate environments where extracting insights from multiple 
document sources is essential.
